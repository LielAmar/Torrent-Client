1. Say a local peer received a piece from remote peer, and now there aren't any pieces the local peer
   wants from the remote peer, although the local peer still doesn't have the whole file.
   Say afterwards the remote peer receives a new piece that the local peer doesn't have. How does the local
   peer knows to start sending REQUEST packets again?
